# Medical Measures App

**Description**

The goal of this application is to use Big data tools such as Hadoop or Spark to render patients medical data and filter records based on diagnoses, diagnosis codes, comorbidity, length of stay, acute admissions, and Emergency visits.
For example, the objective is to run a particular medical measure in the application that will return SQL statements. These SQL queries will contain information suh as the comorbidity diagnoses and diagnosis codes that correspond with that measure and will then run against the database.
