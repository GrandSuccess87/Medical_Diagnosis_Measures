# Medical Measures App

##**Description**

The goal of this application is to use Big data tools such as Hadoop or Spark to render patients medical data and filter records based on diagnoses, diagnosis codes, comorbidity, length of stay, acute admissions, and Emergency visits.
For example, the objective is to run a particular medical measure in the application that will return SQL statements. These SQL queries will contain information suh as the comorbidity diagnoses and diagnosis codes that correspond with that measure and will then run against the database.  

#**Getting started**

These instructions will give you a copy of the project open running on your local machine for development purposes.  To run the application you need to type `node` followed by `the program name` followed by `medical measure name`.
For example, in the command line you will need to type `node/Diagnosis_Measures/copd copd`

###**Prerequisites**

You will need to install Hadoop 3.1.1 and Spark 2.4.0 and Vagrant.
