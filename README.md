# Medical Measures App

**Objective

The goal of this application is to use Big data tools such as Hadoop or Spark to render patients medical data and filter records based on diagnoses, diagnosis codes, comorbidity, length of stay, acute admissions, and Emergency visits.
For Example, you can run a particular medical measure in the application that will return SQL statements/queries which contain information of the comorbidity diagnoses that correspond with that measure and will then be run against the database.
